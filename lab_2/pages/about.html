    <h1>About Sea Otters!</h1>
    
    <div>
      <p>Sea otters, the largest of all otter species, inhabit the coastal waters of the northern Pacific Ocean. Renowned for their playful nature and dense fur, sea otters spend their days floating on their backs, cracking open shellfish, and engaging in social interactions.</p>
      <p>As keystone species, sea otters play a vital role in maintaining the balance of coastal ecosystems by controlling sea urchin populations.</p>
      <p>Sea otters are classified into three distinct species:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Northern Sea Otter (Enhydra lutris kenyoni):</strong> Found along the coasts of the northern Pacific Ocean, from California to Alaska. They have a dense, waterproof coat that insulates them from cold waters.</li>
        <li><strong>Southern Sea Otter (Enhydra lutris nereis):</strong> Inhabit the central coast of California. They are listed as a threatened species due to habitat loss, pollution, and other human impacts.</li>
        <li><strong>Russian Sea Otter (Enhydra lutris lutris):</strong> Found in the waters of the North Pacific, particularly around Russia and the Aleutian Islands. This subspecies was heavily hunted for its fur, leading to significant population declines.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sea otters are highly social animals and often form groups called rafts, consisting of dozens of individuals. They communicate using various vocalizations and body language.</p>
      <p>Despite their endearing nature, sea otters face numerous threats, including habitat degradation, pollution, entanglement in fishing gear, and oil spills. Conservation efforts are essential to protect these charismatic marine mammals and ensure their survival in the wild.</p>
