    <h1>About Sea Otters!</h1>

    <div>
      <p>Sea otters, the largest of all otter species, inhabit the coastal waters of the northern Pacific Ocean.
        Renowned for their playful nature and dense fur, sea otters spend their days floating on their backs, cracking
        open shellfish, and engaging in social interactions.</p>
      <p>As keystone species, sea otters play a vital role in maintaining the balance of coastal ecosystems by
        controlling sea urchin populations.</p>
      <p>Sea otters are classified into three distinct species:</p>

        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Sea Otter Species</th>
            <th>Habitat</th>
            <th>Status</th>
          </tr>

          <tr>

            <td>Central coast of California</td>
            <td>Threatened due to habitat loss, pollution, and other human impacts</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Russian Sea Otter (Enhydra lutris lutris)</td>
            <td>Waters of the North Pacific, particularly around Russia and the Aleutian Islands</td>

      <p>Sea otters are highly social animals and often form groups called rafts, consisting of dozens of individuals.
        They communicate using various vocalizations and body language.</p>

      <p>Despite their endearing nature, sea otters face numerous threats, including habitat degradation, pollution,
        entanglement in fishing gear, and oil spills. Conservation efforts are essential to protect these charismatic
        marine mammals and ensure their survival in the wild.</p>
